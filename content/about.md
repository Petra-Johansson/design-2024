<span class="greeting">&#9758;</span>  About this page 
==========================

On this page I will write about the development of this website. First of, I will present the techniques we are currently working with.

## Techniques:


* **Pico CMS** to handle Markdown files and transform them into HTML.
* **Twig** to create templates.
*  **SCSS** to write our CSS in a modular way and trying to use variables. We will also use more SCSS specific functions nd mixins.
* To add a more personal touch, I am using two fonts from **Google fonts**: *"Poppins"* for headings and *"Figtree"* for parapgraphs, links etcetera.
* I am also using icons from **Font Awesome** aswell as Unicode Icons from **symbl.cc**.


This is the color palette I am using for the theme I am calling *"Winter"*
